# CNNs-from-scratch-on-Mnist
Convolutional Neural Networks model created for the analysis of the Minst dataset using only the Python numpy library
## Description
I developed this model to enhance my skills in the field of artificial intelligence and to deeply understand how CNN models work. Additionally, I utilized Andrew W. Trask's book **Grokking Deep Learning** to grasp the algorithms and engineering behind deep neural networks.
