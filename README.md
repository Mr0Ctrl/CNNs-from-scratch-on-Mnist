# CNNs-from-scratch-on-Mnist
Convolutional Neural Networks model created for the analysis of the Minst dataset using only the Python numpy library
## Description
I developed this model to enhance my skills in the field of artificial intelligence and to deeply understand how CNN models work. Additionally, I utilized Andrew W. Trask's book **Grokking Deep Learning** to grasp the algorithms and engineering behind deep neural networks.

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a clear and straightforward codebase for individuals, like myself, who aim to grasp the fundamental concepts of this field. The code is intentionally kept concise and not overly complex. Additionally, the Jupyter Notebook format includes inline comments to facilitate understanding.
